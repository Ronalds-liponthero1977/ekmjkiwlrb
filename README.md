OMG, just finished Cleaner, and wow, what a ride. Seriously, the way it started, I was like—is this just another one of those blah thrillers? But then, bam, it hit me with that twist! Like, HOW did I not see that coming? The plot just thickened like my grandma's gravy.

You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   ‘cause you're too lazy to go to the theater, thinking, It's just for a lazy night in, but then it turns out to be an emotional roller coaster? That's totally what happened. It had those moments where I was like, “Haha, yeah, right,” but then two seconds later, I’m gripping my seat.

Anyway, those flashbacks got me good. You’d think directors would run out of ways to pull on our heartstrings, but nope. They just keep finding new ways to hit us right where it hurts. And can we talk about that soundtrack? Like, who knew you could get all the feels from just one piano note? Nuts.

> I didn’t even realize until halfway through that the main guy was in that other   we 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥—remember the one with the ridiculous car chases? How does he go from action hero to this intense drama dude? Range, my friend. Oh, and the actress—she was fire. I mean, she's got that I don't need no man vibe but still totally relatable.

Oh, and speaking of visuals, I gotta say, they nailed it with the mood lighting. You 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   thinking it's gonna be all bright and shiny, but then it gets dark, matches the suspense, and it’s like, whoa, I'm in deep now. It's the little things, you know?

Just a little heads-up though: some parts were so tense, I legit forgot to breathe. Had to remind myself! Kind of embarrassing when you're sitting alone and think you're gonna pass out ‘cause of a bloody  . 😂

int main() { std::cout << Hello, World!; return 0; }

But yeah, overall, def worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. I haven’t felt this mix of emotions since that time we tried that spicy ramen challenge, haha. Hit me up when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Can’t wait to hear what you think!
